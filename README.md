# ExtraTrees Multiclass Classifer of Aerobic Activities # 
This is an ExtraTrees Multiclass Classifier of Aerobic Activities from EndoMondo User Data. 
Data is courtesy of Dr. Julian McAuley's Recommender Systems and Personalization Datasets. 

This project explored various models of multiclass classifiers to predict a specific aerobic activity (running, biking, etc.) 
This was done by selecting various features including gender, heart rate, and geographic data and using these to train various models.
