## ExtraTrees Multiclass Classifer of Aerobic Activities ##
This is an ExtraTrees Multiclass Classifier of Aerobic Activities from EndoMondo User Data. 
Data is courtesy of Dr. Julian McAuley's Recommender Systems and Personalization Datasets. Model created for Project 2 in UCSD CSE 258: Recommender Systems and Web Mining course, Fall 2021. 

This project explored various models of multiclass classifiers to predict a specific aerobic activity (running, biking, etc.) 
This was done by selecting various features including gender, heart rate, and geographic data and using these to train various models.
